# Need to make sure the universe repositories are enabled (although if
# you've already installed dh-make-perl then they definitely are)

apt-get update
apt-get install dh-make-perl

apt-get install libmoose-perl libhtml-selector-xpath-perl libxml-libxml-perl

# If dh-make-perl asks you about auto-configuration, just say yes and let
# it do its thing

dh-make-perl --cpan HTML::Grabber --build

# Hopefully at this point you should have a .deb package to install like so:

dpkg -i libhtml-grabber-perl_0.2-1_all.deb
